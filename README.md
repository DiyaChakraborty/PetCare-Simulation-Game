# Pet Care Simulation Game

## Project Overview
This project is a fun and interactive pet care simulation game that allows users to adopt and take care of virtual pets. Players can feed, play with, and rest their pets while managing their health, hunger, and happiness levels.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to create an engaging experience for users, teach basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and demonstrate the functionality of virtual pet care mechanics.

## Functionalities
- **Adoption of Pets**: Users can choose from different types of pets (Dog, Cat, Bird).
- **Pet Management**: Players can feed, play, and rest their pets, impacting their stats.
- **Random Events**: Introduces dynamic interactions to keep the game interesting.
- **Leveling System**: Pets can level up based on their health and happiness.

## Tech Stacks Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Libraries**: Standard Libraries (iostream, string, ctime, cstdlib)
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code

## Conclusion
This pet care simulation game serves as a great example of applying OOP concepts in a practical scenario, providing users with an enjoyable gaming experience.

## Future Development
Future enhancements may include:
- Adding more pet types and breeds.
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more immersive experience.
- Introducing additional features like training and competitions.
